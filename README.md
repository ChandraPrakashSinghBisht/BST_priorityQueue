# BST_priorityQueue
Binary Search Tree using a Priority Queue


A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties âˆ’ The value of the key of the left sub-tree is less than the value of its parent (root) node's key. The value of the key of the right sub-tree is greater than or equal to the value of its parent (root) node's key.

In a priority queue, the highest element is popped whenever we try to either traverse or remove an element. For insertion, higher the element's value, it will be inserted in the 
right side of the BST accordingly.
